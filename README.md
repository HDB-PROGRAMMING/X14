# X14 game engine 🎮
X14 is a minimal open source game engine made by HDB PROGRAMMING to make terminal games with ASCII characters, X14 is a derivative of hShip's game engine, but made for every game.

## Installing X14
In this paragraph I'm going to show you how to install X14 into every compiler's source folder, but only on Windows because X14 requires Windows.h header.

#### Windows
Installing on Windows:
```batch
cd setup
.\setup.bat
```

## A small warning
If you want to use X14 you should inherit this classes:
- **MainObject**: An important object, such as a spaceship in an asteroids game.
- **MinimalObject**: A not important object, such as an asteroid in an asteroids game
